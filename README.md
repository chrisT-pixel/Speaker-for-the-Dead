# Speaker For The Dead

The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility of creating a digital character that looks and sounds like a real person using image and voice recordings, and previous writings of that person.
Over the last several years significant advances in AI, and technologies like ChatGPT and Jaspar, have enabled the ability to create conversational characters. In this project we will explore if we can create a character that acts like a living person by training the character with existing material that the person has created. It is also possible to create realistic looking virtual avatars from several photos, and create recordings that sound like real people using short voice samples.
This project will combine these various existing elements together to create a virtual character that looks and sounds like a real person, and has the knowledge of the person. So a person should be able to ask questions of the digital character and get a realistic response from them. The students will create a prototype and then run a small pilot study to see how realistic people think the character is. The final prototype could be experienced in an Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality experience, or on a mobile phone, or desktop interface.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
